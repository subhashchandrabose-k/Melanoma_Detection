## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.
- The data set contains the following diseases:
	Actinic keratosis
	Basal cell carcinoma
	Dermatofibroma
	Melanoma
	Nevus
	Pigmented benign keratosis
	Seborrheic keratosis
	Squamous cell carcinoma
	Vascular lesion
- We are building a CNN based model which can accurately detect the Melanoma Cancer using the given set of images

## Technologies Used
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SKLearn
- Keras
- Tensorflow

## Conclusions
- Initially we have built basic models which predicted the Melanoma with good results but they are prone to overfitting and class imbalances.
- Treating these problems, we have built a final model which is free from the above problems and gave us improved training and validation accuracies of 95% and 85% respectively
- The improved difference in accuracies explains us that this is a decent model in detecting the Melanoma Cancer disease than the previous models.
